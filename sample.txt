         What is DSS?         
                              
                              
DSS is a terminal .txt slide  
tool that uses premade .txt   
 files similar to this one.   
                              
DSS has an advantage in that  
 You can format and control    
exactly how the slide looks   
                              
DSS slides are simply sections
of a text document that can be 
    easily cycled through
