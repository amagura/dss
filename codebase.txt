[1] Parse user inputs, initialize ncurses, set up variables

[2] Begin parsing the input text file into slide/line structs

[3] slides.c provides functions for generating and freeing slide/line structs

[4] slides are returned to main.c where they are sent to the displayLoop
    function. on return main.c will check to see if a file is to be open. 
    this logic is in the do while loop at the bottom of main.c

[5] display.c will print the tile, slide(s) and bottom bar, from here the loop
    will continuously ckeck user input and perform actions based on that input.
    eventually the loop will return to main.c.

[6] parsecommand.c provides logic for building command structs which are used 
    in the ":" mode

main.cCOLOR="yB"

    * parsing is handled immediatly, 'v' and 'h' flags used for version and
      usage information. Otherwise we'll get the filename here

    * setlocale() is used to enable UTF-8 support (also the reason why we
      use -lncursesw flag in the Makefile)

    * after setting a few variables, we'll attempt to open the file at the
      file name given. after this we'll initialize the display.

    * We build our slide structs from the opened file by calling parseTXT.
      the line structs will also be built for each slide here. pointer to
      the first slide is returned. after this the file is closed

    * displayLoop is called now. it'll return a code that is used to signal
      main to open and parse a new file.

    * freeing of lines and slides occurs right at the end of the do while
      loop. 

    * If no file is to be opened, we simply end the loop and return 
      EXIT_SUCCESS.
