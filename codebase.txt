[1] Parse user inputs, initialize ncurses, set up variables

[2] Begin parsing the input text file into slide/line structs

[3] slides.c provides functions for generating and freeing slide/line structs

[4] slides are returned to main.c where they are sent to the displayLoop
    function. on return main.c will check to see if a file is to be open. 
    this logic is in the do while loop at the bottom of main.c

[5] display.c will print the tile, slide(s) and bottom bar, from here the loop
    will continuously ckeck user input and perform actions based on that input.
    eventually the loop will return to main.c.

[6] parsecommand.c provides logic for building command structs which are used 
    in the ":" mode
